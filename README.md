Explicit GL (XGL) Sample Implementation
=======================================
Version 0.1, 1 Sep 2014

This project provides a sample implementation of an XGL driver running on 
Intel's Haswell, IvyBridge and SandyBridge GPUs within the Linux Desktop
Environment. This implementation is being shared with the Khronos community
to provide early insights into the specification of XGL. It is written to
the 0.1 version of the XGL specification, dated 1 Jul 2014. It supports a
subset of the full specification, including:

	First Triangles with hardcoded shaders

This work is intended to be released as open source under a BSD-style
license once the XGL specification is public. Until that time, this work
is covered by the Khronos NDA governing the details of the XGL API.

While this project is being developed by LunarG, Inc; there are many other
companies and individuals making this possible: Valve Software, funding
project development; Intel Corporation, providing full hardware specifications
and valuable technical feedback; AMD, providing XGL spec editor contributions;
ARM, contributing a Chairman for this working group within Khronos; Nvidia,
providing an initial co-editor for the spec; Qualcomm for picking up the
co-editor's chair; and Khronos, for providing hosting within GitHub.

If you have questions or comments about this driver, please post those to
gl_common@khronos.org; or if you prefer, directly to LunarG via XGL@LunarG.com
