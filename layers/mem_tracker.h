/*
 * Data Structure overview
 *  There are 4 global STL(' maps
 *  cbMap -- map of command Buffer (CB) objects to MT_CB_INFO structures
 *    Each MT_CB_INFO struct has an stl list container with
 *    memory objects that are referenced by this CB
 *  memObjMap -- map of Memory Objects to MT_MEM_OBJ_INFO structures
 *    Each MT_MEM_OBJ_INFO has two stl list containers with:
 *      -- all CBs referencing this mem obj
 *      -- all VK Objects that are bound to this memory
 *  objectMap -- map of objects to MT_OBJ_INFO structures
 *
 * Algorithm overview
 * These are the primary events that should happen related to different objects
 * 1. Command buffers
 *   CREATION - Add object,structure to map
 *   CMD BIND - If mem associated, add mem reference to list container
 *   DESTROY  - Remove from map, decrement (and report) mem references
 * 2. Mem Objects
 *   CREATION - Add object,structure to map
 *   OBJ BIND - Add obj structure to list container for that mem node
 *   CMB BIND - If mem-related add CB structure to list container for that mem node
 *   DESTROY  - Flag as errors any remaining refs and remove from map
 * 3. Generic Objects
 *   MEM BIND - DESTROY any previous binding, Add obj node w/ ref to map, add obj ref to list container for that mem node
 *   DESTROY - If mem bound, remove reference list container for that memInfo, remove object ref from map
